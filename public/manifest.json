    "details": "Change is a beautiful phenomenon- at least that’s how I like to think of it. It is alive and constant and this makes it very powerful. When the course of life treads a new path, and if the direction is something that makes us happy, the realization feels just like magic. I’ve always believed that change is possible if we live pro actively and not as passive bystanders in our own lives. This realization dawns upon us in moments that I like to think of as ‘milestones’ that become our defining moments. A life of travel has been my dream for quite sometime now and it’s no surprise that my important ‘milestones’ are (and probably will be) travel related. Like the time I was on a ferry on the River Padha near Amdala village in Bangladesh, on my first solo trip ever to intern with the Grameen Bank. There was nothing particularly spectacular about the moment in the usual sense, but to me it was an extraordinary evening. I stood atop a ferry in silence and watched as the sun slowly descended as if into the river. Around me were my new friends and strangers in an intimate moment of prayer. On their way home from work, they knelt on mats spread out on the deck, offering the evening prayer under the open sky. As a million stars slowly lit up the sky",

    "details": "One of the best things about traveling in our times is that you can now apply for your tourist visas online instead of visiting the embassies of countries around the world, and yes, this is possible even in Asia. Compare this to times when travelers had to queue up at embassies and make a total of at least three trips there to secure a visa on their passport. Now you can do it from the comfort of your home with one click. This is very convenient for travelers who wish to visit Asia and don’t want to deal with the time and bureaucracy associated with applying for a visa at an embassy.",

    "details": "Like everyone, I’d heard about Swiss and Belgian chocolate, often in contest for the best chocolate in the world, but not a thing about Spanish chocolate, that could well be in the running. So when I had the chance to go on the City of Chocolate tour, a walking chocolate tour hosted by Context Travel in Barcelona, I felt both curious and excited about unearthing a lesser-known secret about the city and sampling the best chocolate in Barcelona. Though I’d been on food tours and walking tours of Barcelona, this was a first. After all, to the common food-loving traveler, few things can be as exciting as the prospect of exploring a new culture through its fine chocolate. ",
